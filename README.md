This is a personal plugin for neovim. It won't be useful to anyone else because it uses a tool that I'm currently keeping private that scrapes a website to get bible scriptures and maybe in the future other publications.
I had to make this public just because I didn't want to link to a local folder to use it, since it would be a mess when using multiple computers.

Just ignore this.
