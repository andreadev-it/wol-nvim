This is a personal plugin for neovim. It won't be useful to anyone else because it uses a tool that I'm currently keeping private that scrapes a website to get bible scriptures and maybe in the future other publications.
I had to make this public just because I didn't want to link to a local folder to use it, since it would be a mess when using multiple computers.

In case I forget, it requires nui.nvim to work.

If you want to see how to run a terminal command or how to open a popup with nui.nvim, feel free to look at the code, otherwise just ignore this.
